A robot car using nothing but hand gestures? This project does just that‚Äîyour webcam sees your hand (input), interprets which fingers are out using *mediapipe*, and sends a command (wirelessly!) using *USP Wifi* to an *ESP32* microcontroller that moves the car accordingly.

## ‚ú® Features

- **Live Gesture Control:** A Python app on your computer uses a webcam and MediaPipe to figure out how many fingers are up, then matches that to a movement command.
- **No Wires Needed:** The ESP32 becomes a WiFi hotspot. Your computer connects directly, so the system works even outdoors‚Äîno router required.
- **Simple Gesture Map:**  
  | Fingers        | Car Action    |
  |:--------------:|:-------------|
  | Fist (0)       | Stop         |
  | 1              | Forward      |
  | 2              | Backward     |
  | 3              | Turn Left    |
  | 4              | Turn Right   |

## ‚öôÔ∏è How the System Comes Together

There are two main parts:

### 1. Your Computer (Python Controller)
- Runs `input_fingers.py`.
- Captures webcam video.
- MediaPipe analyzes the hand and counts extended fingers.
- The script sends this count by UDP WiFi to the ESP32.

### 2. The Car (ESP32 + Motors)
- Runs `car_code.ino` (Arduino sketch).
- ESP32 acts as a WiFi hotspot with its own SSID and password.
- Listens for UDP packets (on port 4210).
- Matches the finger count to a motion, then signals the motor driver to move the car.

## üõ†Ô∏è Technology Stack

- **Vision & Control:** Python with OpenCV and MediaPipe
- **On-Car Logic:** C++ via Arduino IDE for ESP32
- **Hardware:** ESP32, motor driver (TB6612FNG/L298N), DC motors
- **Comms:** WiFi UDP

---

## üõí What You Need

- ESP32 development board
- Car chassis (2 or 4 motors)
- Motor driver compatible with ESP32 (e.g., L298N)
- Power for ESP32 + motors (LiPo, power bank, or similar)
- Computer with webcam

---

## üîå Hardware Setup (ESP32 + Car)

- **Connect Motor Driver Inputs:**
  - Motor A: `AIN1` (GPIO 26), `AIN2` (GPIO 25), `PWMA` (GPIO 33)
  - Motor B: `BIN1` (GPIO 14), `BIN2` (GPIO 12), `PWMB` (GPIO 13)
  - Standby: `STDBY` (GPIO 27)
- Wire outputs from the driver to your motors and ensure common GND.

## üíª Software Setup

### Arduino/ESP32

1. Install Arduino IDE & add ESP32 support.
2. Load `car_code.ino` and set your desired WiFi SSID/PASSWORD (optional).
3. Upload the sketch and open the serial monitor (9600 baud). The ESP32 should broadcast its AP (default IP: 192.168.4.1).

### Python Controller

1. Clone your repo on the computer you‚Äôll use for control.
2. Install dependencies:
    ```
    pip install opencv-python mediapipe
    ```
3. Connect your computer to the ESP32's WiFi.
4. Run:
    ```
    python input_fingers.py
    ```
5. You‚Äôll see your webcam video. Raise your hand‚Äîfist stops, one finger forward, and so on!

## üìù Tips & Notes

- Make sure both ESP32 and the controlling computer have sufficient power and share the same WiFi network.
- Lighting can affect gesture recognition‚Äîensure your hand is visible and well-lit.
- If the car does not respond, check serial logs on the ESP32 and confirm correct IP in the Python script.

---

## üìà Possible Expansions

- Add more gestures for advanced controls
- Implement feedback from the car (e.g., acknowledge commands)
- Stream live camera feed from the car using ESP32-CAM module
- Replace hand gestures with face or color tracking
